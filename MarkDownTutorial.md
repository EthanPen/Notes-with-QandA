####Lesson1: Italics and Bold

	**Writing in _Markdown_ is not that hard!**

####Lesson2: Headers

	###Header one
	####Header two
	#####Header three
 
####Lesson3: Links

There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way. The first link style is called an inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). 

**inline links**

	The Latest News from [the BBC](www.bbc.com/news)

The Latest News from [the BBC](www.bbc.com/news)

**reference link**

	Do you want to [see something fun][a fun place]?
	
	Well, do I have [the website for you][another fun place]!
	
	[a fun place]: www.zombo.com
	[another fun place]: www.stumbleupon.com

	
Do you want to [see something fun][a fun place]?

Well, do I have [the website for you][another fun place]!

[a fun place]: www.zombo.com
[another fun place]: www.stumbleupon.com
	
	

####Lesson4: Images

**reference image**

For a reference image, you'll follow the same pattern as a reference link. You'll precede the Markdown with an exclamation point ( **!** ), then provide two brackets for the alt text, and then two more for the image tag. At the bottom of your Markdown page, you'll define an image for the tag.

####Lesson5: Blockquotes

To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the "greater than" caret (>). For example:
	
	
	I read this interesting quote the other day:
	
	> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"
	

I read this interesting quote the other day:

> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"  


####Lesson6: Lists

**unordered list**  
preface each item in the list with an asterisk *  

example  

	* Milk
	* Eggs
	* Butter
	
* Milk
* Eggs
* Butter

**ordered List**  
An ordered list is prefaced with numbers, instead of asterisks.

example

	1. Crack three eggs over a bowl
	2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl
	3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter
	
1. Crack three eggs over a bowl
2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl
3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter

** make a list with more depth, or, to nest one list within another**

example

	* Tintin
	 	* A reporter
	 	* Has poofy orange hair
	* Haddock
	 	* A sea captain
	 		* Possibly also scotch?
* Tintin
 	* A reporter
 	* Has poofy orange hair
* Haddock
 	* A sea captain
 		* Possibly also scotch?


**Further explore**  
To create this sort of text, your paragraph must start on a line all by itself underneath the bullet point, and it must be indented by at least one space. For example, the list above looks like this in Markdown:
	
	1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.
	
	 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.
	
	 If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!
	
	2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.
	
	 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!
	
	3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter.
	
	   By "vigorous," we mean a strictly vertical motion. Julia Child once quipped:
	   > Up and down and all around, that's how butter on salmon goes.
	4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl.
	
	   Here are some techniques on salmon-dropping:
	
	   * Make sure no trout or children are present
	   * Use both hands
	   * Always have a towel nearby in case of messes
	   

####Lesson7: Paragraphs

inserting two spaces after each new line.
